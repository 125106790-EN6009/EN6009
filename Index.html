<h1>This is my Portfolio for EN6009</h1>
<p>Reading “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots” made me reflect on aspects of language models that I had never considered before. An extremely important point is that these systems are mainly based on a database that spans the entire web. As it is important to remember, the web is a place accessible to anyone, with little filtering of the content that is published or viewed. These systems therefore rely on data without content filtering. The models absorb information provided by every website and every person, without taking into account the meaning of the sentence.

Inevitably, no filters are applied to the information gathered from various sources on the web. As a result, LM systems are based on information that contains social prejudices, stereotypes and insults linked to all forms of discrimination, whether racist, sexist, religious or otherwise. Although at first glance a tool such as LM may seem innovative and impressive, what lies behind the scenes is quite different. As with any tool, it is up to the individual to reflect on the suggestions offered. What at first glance may seem like a suggestion without any logical connection, such as response suggestions in chat teams or emails, is actually an analysis of data found on the web that the system considers relevant. It is therefore necessary to think critically and avoid being misled by tools that present themselves as innovations to help and sometimes replace a person's critical thinking and reasoning.

What struck me most is that the real problem is not only technical accuracy, but also the ethical and social consequences of reproducing unfair patterns of society itself.
